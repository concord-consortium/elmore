# Elmore: A Dev Day 2018 Project

This was a 1 day project created by Doug Martin, Noah Paessel and Kirk Swenson at the Concord Consortium to replace the [log manager](https://github.com/concord-consortium/Data-Analytics-Log-Manager) with a Phoenix app that would expose a channel that could be consumed by an Elm frontend (TDB: add link to that repo).

Like all 1 day projects we bit off more than we could chew.  While this part of the project works it was hacked up at the very end to expose all incoming traffic in a debug div on the homepage.

DO NOT USE THIS AS A BASIS FOR ANY FUTURE PHOENIX PROJECTS! :)

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
